## About Me

I am a security professional with experience in safeguarding sensitive information within the healthcare industry. My role involves managing access to personal patient records and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

## Project Details

### Scenario

As part of my responsibilities, I regularly update a file that identifies employees with access to restricted content. This process involves maintaining an allow list for IP addresses and removing unauthorized IPs.

### Algorithm

The Python code provided in this repository automates the process of checking and updating the allow list based on a remove list. It identifies and removes any IPs listed in the remove list from the allow list.

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm is implemented in Python and performs the following steps:

1. Define the allow list and remove list.
2. Create a function to remove IPs from the allow list.
3. Call the function to get the updated allow list.

For a detailed code walkthrough, refer to the Python script provided in this repository.

## Usage

To use this algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Replace the example IP addresses in the Python script with your actual data.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.

The updated allow list will be printed to the console.

## File Structure

- `security_algorithm.py`: Python script containing the algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the portfolio.
